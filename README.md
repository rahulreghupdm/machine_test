Database Helper
The DatabaseHelper class is responsible for managing the SQLite database. It includes methods for initializing the database, creating the table, inserting posts, fetching posts, and clearing the database.


Fetch Controller
The FetchController class is responsible for fetching data from the API, storing it in the local database, and managing the state of the application. It uses the ChangeNotifier to notify listeners when the state changes.

Post Model
The Post class represents the structure of a post. It includes a factory constructor to create a Post object from JSON and a method to convert a Post object to a map.

List Page View
The ListPageView class is a stateless widget that displays the list of posts. It uses the Consumer widget to listen for changes in the FetchController and updates the UI accordingly.
